Welcome to opendevelop's documentation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview
========

OpenDevelop is an open source platform dedicated on facilitating the procedure
of running code. It provides a state-of-the-art asynchronous REST API to allow
users run their code with a single HTTP request. OpenDevelop has been designed
and designated to be used by `sourceLair <https://www.sourcelair.com/>`_  as its
sole backend for any code-executing task.

However it is also opensource so that anyone can set up a private opendevelop
installation.

Opendevelop is based on the following technologies

* `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/>`_
* `Docker <https://www.docker.io/>`_
* `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`_

**Caution:** Right now OpenDevelop is in Alpha stage and under heavy development. The documentation might not be complete and we 
do not suggest using it for a production system at the moment.
